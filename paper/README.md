This paper is work in progress, and is intented for submission to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). The following items are needed before it will be published:

- [ ] Find citations for:
  - [x]  morphogenesis on understanding how deviations from optimality affect key design
objectives

  - [x] compliance minimization problems

  - [ ] material deposition in:
    - [x] structural applications
    - [x] optical applications
    - [x] hydrodynamic applications
    - [ ] thermodynamic applications

  - [x] why above is necessary in engineering design

  - [x] a couple citations for more topology optimization codes

  - [ ] continuum problems in topology optimization

- [ ] Publishing as a public GitHub repo

- [ ] Publishing of documentation

- [ ] Upload a "0.1" release to Zenodo for a citable DOI

- [ ] When the sister-paper (Hyperoptimization for computational morphogenesis, in progress) is published to the ArXiv, update that reference in this paper

- [ ] Submit to JOSS
