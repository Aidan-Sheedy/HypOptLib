abstract = {Topology optimization (TopOpt) methods for inverse design of nano-photonic systems have recently become extremely popular and are presented in various forms and under various names. Approaches comprise gradient- and non-gradient-based algorithms combined with more or less systematic ways to improve convergence, discreteness of solutions, and satisfaction of manufacturing constraints. We here provide a tutorial for the systematic and efficient design of nano-photonic structures by TopOpt. The implementation is based on the advanced and systematic approaches developed in TopOpt for structural optimization during the last three decades. The tutorial presents a step-by-step guide for deriving the continuous constrained optimization problem forming the foundation of the TopOpt method, using a cylindrical metalens design problem as an example. It demonstrates the effect and necessity of applying a number of auxiliary tools in the design process to ensure good numerical modeling practice and to achieve physically realizable designs. Application examples also include an optical demultiplexer.},

TITLE = {A Review of Topology Optimisation for Fluid-Based Problems},
JOURNAL = {Fluids},
VOLUME = {5},
YEAR = {2020},

ABSTRACT = {This review paper provides an overview of the literature for topology optimisation of fluid-based problems, starting with the seminal works on the subject and ending with a snapshot of the state of the art of this rapidly developing field. “Fluid-based problems” are defined as problems where at least one governing equation for fluid flow is solved and the fluid–solid interface is optimised. In addition to fluid flow, any number of additional physics can be solved, such as species transport, heat transfer and mechanics. The review covers 186 papers from 2003 up to and including January 2020, which are sorted into five main groups: pure fluid flow; species transport; conjugate heat transfer; fluid–structure interaction; microstructure and porous media. Each paper is very briefly introduced in chronological order of publication. A quantititive analysis is presented with statistics covering the development of the field and presenting the distribution over subgroups. Recommendations for focus areas of future research are made based on the extensive literature review, the quantitative analysis, as well as the authors’ personal experience and opinions. Since the vast majority of papers treat steady-state laminar pure fluid flow, with no recent major advancements, it is recommended that future research focuses on more complex problems, e.g., transient and turbulent flow.},
